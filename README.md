# pkt2flow
This tools transform a packet input in a flow output based on the 5-tuple

## Configuration

In the file configuration.h is possible to set the abstraction configuration before compiling the code


## Instalation

	sudo apt install libpcap0.8-dev

	gcc -Wall -o pkt2flow pkt2flow.c -lpcap -lm

## Execution

./pkt2flow [pcap-file]

For live capture, do not set pcap-file option

## Testing

Execute the code with the dataset/sample.pcap 

The output must be equal to the sample.csv file
